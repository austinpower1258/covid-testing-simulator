# covid-testing-simulator

Utilized non-trivial use of recursion to solve a relevant problem regarding COVID pool testing optmization in relation to Yale's undergraduate situation, assuming that 1% are infected. This is assuming that the population is selected at random for COVID and not clustered into any specific groups or times.
